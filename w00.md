# Top 10 List of Week 00

1. [How Does Computer Works?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAx_6-wdslM&list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)<br>
Here’s a playlist contains of some short video featuring Bill Gates and some famous technology practitioners in industry. The videos show us a clear informations about computers in the past and now, also about how does computer works in real life. Most importantly, the video give us some simple explanations about Binary and Data; Circuits and Logic; CPU, Memory, Input, and Output; and lastly about Hardware and Software.

2. [Operating System](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/)<br>
An operating system is software that manages the computer’s hardware. OS also provides a basis for application programs and acts as an intermediary between a computer user and a computer hardware.

3. [Hierarchy of Computer System Organization](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mssz/CompOrg/CDAintro.html)<br>
Operating system; Assembler - Assembly language, a primitive type of programming language, into machines code, which is stream of ones and zeroes; Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) - Interfaces the software (listed above) to the hardware (listed below), and provides support for programming; Processor, Memory, and I/O System are the components to support the execution of machine code instructions expressed in terms of the ISA; Datapath and Control there to provide a convenient abstraction for connecting the processor, memory, and I/O system and controlling their function efficiently.

4. [Processor Management](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/operating-system)<br>
When the OS runs a piece of software it has to find the program files on the storage drive, load them into main memory, and instruct the CPU to start executing the program from the beginning. The OS makes it possible to run several programs at once. Several programs can be stored in RAM at the same time, however only one program at a time is processed by the CPU.

5. [Memory Management](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/OSNotes/os.html)<br>
Memory management is responsible for keeping track of what parts of memory are being used by which processes also dynamically allocating dan freeing memory space. 

6. [Storage Management](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/OSNotes/os.html)<br>
Storage Management is the processes that help make data storage easier through software or techniques. Main memory is usually too small to accommodate all the data and programs permanently, the computer system must provide secondary storage to back up main memory.

7. [Device Management](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~schmidt/300s05/Lectures/OSNotes/os.html)<br>
The operating system also protects devices like the printer and disk so that they are used fairly and correctly. Specifically, the OS ensures that two processes do not "fight" to use a device at the same instant. To ensure this, for each input/output device, the operating system builds a queue that holds the IDs of the processes that wish to use the device.

8. [Von Neumann Model VS. Harvard Model](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331160423_Von-Neumann_Architecture_Vs_Harvard_Architecture)<br>
Von Neumann's computer architecture design consists of a Control Unit, Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), Memory Unit, Registers and Inputs/Outputs. The main drawback is the CPU unable to access program memory and data memory simultaneously and affected the system performance. So, Harvard Model created to overcome the bottleneck of Von Neumann's Model.

9. [Multicore VS Multithreading](https://www.os-book.com/OS10/)<br>
Multicore refers to a computer or processor that has more than one logical CPU core, and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time. Multithreading refers to a program that can take advantage of a multicore computer by running on more than one core at the same time.

10. [Virtualization](https://youtu.be/FZR0rG3HKIk)<br>
Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs). Each VM runs its own operating system (OS) and behaves like an independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of the actual underlying computer hardware.
