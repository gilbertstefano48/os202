# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [FUSE](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
File-System in User Space or commonly known as FUSE is a framework in which kernel components can be executed with application programs, user mode file system mode, and display them to the application so that they look like a system file. In FUSE, we don't need to do any kernel code editing. FUSE is usually available on many operating systems, such as Linux, FreeBSD, OpenSolaris, Minix 3, and macOs.

2. [File-System Interface](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
A File System is an implementation of files using disk. Files can be mapped by the operating system to a physical device. This physical device is a non-volatile storage device so that the stored data will not be lost even though the computer is not running (dead). For example, we can create files, write files, read files, even delete files. Files also have several attributes, for example: names, file types (.java, .pdf, .sh, .txt, .mp4, .3gp, etc.) storage location that we can track via the pwd command on the terminal, file size, protection which means who can access the file, as well as the identification of the file, for example when the file was created (in the form of time and date) and when the last modification was made to the file.

3. [Linux File Structure](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-directory-structure-and-file-system-hierarchy/)<br>
Here are the most common top level directories that you need to be aware of and may interact with as a user of a Linux system.

4. [File-System Structure](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
Disks provides most of the secondary storage where system files are maintained. There are two characteristics:
* The disk is rewritable in its place, means that we can read a block from the disk, modify it, and rewrite it on the same block.
* Disk can directly access any content / information from each block. So, it is quite easy for us to access files both in order, randomly, and when switching from one file to another with a drive that moves the pointer to read and write. <br>

5. [File-System Hierarchy Standard](http://openstorage.gunadarma.ac.id/linux/docs/v06/Kuliah/SistemOperasi/BUKU/SistemOperasi-4.X-2/ch15.html)<br>
The File-System Hierarchy Standard is a standard rule for the location of files and directories on the operating system. With this standard, users and software can find out where a file or directory is stored on a computer. This File-System Hierarchy can be created by:
* Define basic instructions for each area on the file system.
* Specifies the minimum required files and directories.
* Mark every exception.
* Mark each specific case that has experienced a conflict.

6. [File Access Method](https://fajar96artikel.blogspot.com/2016/11/sistem-operasi-chapter-12-file-system.html)<br>
There are 3 methods that are commonly known in accessing files:
* Sequiential Access Method
Sequiential Access Method is the simplest file access method. Information on files is accessed sequentially, so each subsequent file will be accessed after the previous file. This access method is based on the tape model of a file that works with Sequiential Access or Random Access devices. For example, the operations used are read next, write next, and reset.
* Direct Access Method
A file access method based on the disk model of a file, which allows us to read and write files randomly to any block of files. The file operation is modified to enter the block number as the parameter of the file you wish to modify. The user-defined block number is a relative block number, for example the index relative to the start of the file.
* Other Access Method
A file access method that can actually reference just like the direct access method. This additional method usually involves constructs for files. If we want to specify an input in a file, we need to look up the index, and then use a pointer to access the file directly and find roughly what the input is. The index of a file can be stored in memory, which if the file is large, the index will also be relatively large to be stored in memory. We can solve this by creating an index file in the index file. For example, suppose we have a primary index file which contains a pointer to a secondary index file, which points to the actual data item. Perhaps, the implementation is similar to using folders on our computer system, where we can group a large number of files, into folders that we can easily identify in search.

7. [Directory Implementation](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation)<br>
The choice of directory allocation algorithm and directory management can significantly affect the efficiency, performance, and performance of the file system. Directory implementation algorithms are classified according to the data structure used. There are two algorithms that are commonly used: Linear List and Hash Table

8. [Allocation Methods](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
There are 3 main methods of allocating secondary storage space that are commonly used: Contiguous Allocation, Linked Allocation, and Indexed Allocation

9. [Free Space Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/free-space-management-in-operating-system/)<br>
Free Space Management makes the file system responsible for allocating free block space to files. To reuse the free space in the blocks released from file deletion, free space management is quite important, namely by tracing which blocks are free on disk. List of free spaces can be implemented as Bitmap or Bit vector, Linked List, Grouping, and Counting.

10. [Virtual File-System](https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-file-system-VFS)<br>
Virtual File-System is a programming that forms a more concrete interface between the kernel and the file system. The Virtual File-System serves as an abstraction layer that provides applications access to various types of file systems and local and network storage devices. Therefore, the Virtual File-System is also known as the switch of the virtual file system. This VFS also manages data storage and retrieval between the operating system and the storage sub-system. VFS maintains a directory lookup cache to enable easy location of frequently accessed directories.
