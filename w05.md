# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory -> W04 poin 8](https://gilbertstefano48.github.io/os202/W04/)<br>
Well in this week, we talk about Virtual Memory, but i already talk about it in my last week top 10 list's. So, check it out!

2. [Difference between Buffering and Caching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-buffering-and-caching-in-os/)<br>
In computer system when the speed in which data is received and the speed in which data is processed are different, then there we use the buffer. Buffer is a memory space which stores the input data and pass it on to the system according to this speed in this way there is no need to hold the input device until it is processed. simply the data will be stored in buffer and the used by the system. The buffer can be of any type, hardware or software, but in general software buffer are used widely. Meanwhile, Caching is storing data in a separate disk (very fast speed disk). The data which is to be used many times results in wastage of time if it is in hard disk, but storing the data in cache reduces this time wastage.

3. [Devices that use Virtual Memory](https://classroom.synonym.com/devices-use-virtual-memory-16358.html)<br>
It turns out that virtual memory can be applied to various devices depending on what is being applied. For example, Virtual Memory which is applied to tablets and smartphones, is used to store the inactive state on the device, applications that are open but not used. So that main memory is made free for use by other applications. Then on video game consoles, for example the playstation, use virtual memory to improve system performance. The improved performance is when pre-loading content from the optical drive and saving game information. So, when we open the game, the loading will be faster and we can start playing immediately.

4. [Advantages of using virtual memory](https://aticleworld.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Among the primary benefits of virtual memory is its ability to handle twice as many addresses as main memory. It uses software to consume more memory by using the HDD as temporary storage while MMUs translate virtual memory addresses to physical addresses via the CPU. Programs use virtual addresses to store instructions and data; when a program is executed, the virtual addresses are converted into actual memory addresses.

5. [Virtual Memory History](https://networkencyclopedia.com/virtual-memory/)<br>
The concept of virtual memory was first developed by German physicist Fritz-Rudolf Güntsch at the Technische Universität Berlin in 1956 in his doctoral thesis, Logical Design of a Digital Computer with Multiple Asynchronous Rotating Drums and Automatic High Speed Memory Operation; it described a machine with 6 100-word blocks of primary core memory and an address space of 1,000 100-word blocks, with hardware automatically moving blocks between primary memory and secondary drum memory.

6.[Memory Compression](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
Memory compression is a memory management technique that compresses a number of pages into a single page. Compressed memory is an alternative for paging and is used on mobile systems that do not support paging.

7.[Contiguous and Non-Contiguous memory allocation](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/contiguous-and-non-contiguous-memory-allocation.aspx)<br>
In contiguous memory allocation, all the available memory space remain together in one place. It means freely available memory partitions are not scattered here and there across the whole memory space. Meanwhile in the non-contiguous memory allocation, the available free memory space are scattered here and there and all the free memory space is not at one place. A process will acquire the memory space but it is not at one place it is at the different locations according to the process requirement.

8.[Memory Allocation Algorithm for Cloud Services](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-017-2069-8)<br>
Memory allocation is a process that assigns physical or virtual memory space to programs and services as efficiently and quickly as possible. Economical memory allocation management needs allocation strategies with minimum wastage. In this paper, you will be introduced to a new memory allocation algorithm based on sequential fits and zoning for on-demand (online) cloud services, with simulation to compare our new mechanism with existing memory allocation methods that have been deployed using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud as a test bed.

9.[Allocating kernel memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/)<br>
There are two strategies for managing free memory that is assigned to kernel processes:
1. Buddy system
Buddy allocation system is an algorithm in which a larger memory block is divided into small parts to satisfy the request. This algorithm is used to give best fit. The two smaller parts of block are of equal size and called as buddies. In the same manner one of the two buddies will further divide into smaller parts until the request is fulfilled.
2. Slab Allocation
Slab Allocation eliminates fragmentation caused by allocations and deallocations. This method is used to retain allocated memory that contains a data object of a certain type for reuse upon subsequent allocations of objects of the same type. In slab allocation memory chunks suitable to fit data objects of certain type or size are preallocated

10.[Network Devices](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-devices-hub-repeater-bridge-switch-router-gateways/?ref=leftbar-rightbar)<br>
There are 7 types of network devices that explained in this website, but here's the summary for 5 of it:
1. Repeater
A repeater operates at the physical layer. Its job is to regenerate the signal over the same network before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted so as to extend the length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same network.
2. Hub
A hub is basically a multiport repeater. A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations.
3. Bridge
A bridge operates at data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of source and destination. It is also used for interconnecting two LANs working on the same protocol.
4. Switch
A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance. It is a data link layer device. The switch can perform error checking before forwarding data, that makes it very efficient as it does not forward packets that have errors and forward good packets selectively to correct port only.
5. Router
A router is a device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP addresses. Router is mainly a Network Layer device. Routers normally connect LANs and WANs together and have a dynamically updating routing table based on which they make decisions on routing the data packets.
