# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/cpu-scheduling#)<br>
CPU scheduling is a process which allows one process to use the CPU while the execution of another process is on hold(in waiting state) due to unavailability of any resource like I/O etc, thereby making full use of CPU. The aim of CPU scheduling is to make the system efficient, fast and fair.

2. [Different Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/)<br>
There are some scheduling algorithms that exist and usually used, such as: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Longest Job First (LJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF), Round Robin Scheduling, Priority Based scheduling (Non-Preemptive), Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN), Multilevel Queue Scheduling, and Multi level Feedback Queue Scheduling. This link will give you a brief description about each algorithm.

3. [Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)<br>
Preemptive Scheduling is a scheduling method where the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities. Sometimes it is important to run a task with a higher priority before another lower priority task, even if the lower priority task is still running. Non-Preemptive Scheduling is a scheduling method where the CPU has been allocated to a specific process. The process that keeps the CPU busy will release the CPU either by switching context or terminating. This link will give you more about hand-to-hand comparison between two of them, also advantages dan disadvantages of each scheduling method.

4. [Types of schedulers](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hamilton/courses/330/notes/scheduling/scheduling.html#:~:text=CPU%20burst%3A%20the%20amount%20of,it%20is%20no%20longer%20ready)<br>
There are 3 main types of scheduler: long-term scheduler, medium-term scheduler, and short-term scheduler (a.k.a CPU scheduler) this link will give you a brief explanation of each type, and this link also give you more explanation about scheduling algorithms! (poin 2)

5. [CPU burst and I/O burst](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Editions)<br>
* CPU Burst : It is the amount of time required by a process or can be said the amount of time required by the process to finish. We can not estimate the time taken by the process before running it. So most of the problem is related to the burst time. Burst Time = Turn around Time(Completion Time)-Waiting Time
* I/O Burst : While the process is in the running state, it may ask for i/o , thus the process goes to the block or wait state, where the i/o will be processed and then it will be sent back to the ready state.

6. [Earliest-Deadline-First Scheduling](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Editions)<br>
Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) Scheduling sets priorities dynamically according to deadlines. The faster the deadline, the higher the priority, and vice versa. In the EDF rules, when a process can be executed, it must announce the deadline requirements to the system. Priorities may need to be adjusted to reflect the deadlines of the current process. Notice how this differs from rate-monotonic scheduling, where the priorities are fixed

7. [Load Balancing](https://www.citrix.com/en-in/glossary/load-balancing.html)<br>
Load balancing is defined as an efficient distribution method of network or application traffic in a server field. Each load balancer sits between the client device and the backend server, receiving and then distributing incoming requests to the available servers that are capable of fulfilling them. Load balancing in multicore systems equalizes loads between CPU cores, although migrating threads between cores to balance the load can invalidate cached content and therefore increase memory access times.

8. [Symmetric vs Asymmetric Multiprocessing](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-asymmetric-and-symmetric-multiprocessing)<br>
Symmetric multiprocessing is the use of two or more self-scheduling processors that share the same memory space. Each processor has I / O access and a memory device. Symmetric multiprocessing applies multiple CPUs to complete tasks in parallel and faster. Meanwhile, asymmetric multiprocessing is the use of two or more processors which are handled by one master processor. All CPUs are interconnected, but not self-scheduling. Asymmetric multiprocessing is used to schedule specific tasks to the CPU based on priority and importance of task

9. [Windows Task Scheduler Software](https://www.advsyscon.com/en-us/activebatch/job-scheduling/task-scheduler)<br>
Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler is used to create basic tasks and to manage task scheduling. But much like UNIX cron or Z-Cron, Task Scheduler is a point solution designed for simplistic use cases. Task Scheduler can be used for nightly batch files, but to coordinate tasks between Windows and non-Windows applications, you'll need custom PowerShell scripts or integrations. To get around scripting and command lines, IT teams can implement additional schedulers for specific jobs, for example using a free version of a schedule manager. These freeware solutions are not designed for enterprise-level scheduling and lack modern scheduling capabilities like event-driven automation.

10. [Scheduling in Real-Time Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)<br>
A real-time scheduling system consists of a scheduler, clock, and processing hardware elements. In a real-time system, processes or tasks have a schedulability; Tasks are received by the real-time system and completed as determined by the task deadline depending on the characteristics of the scheduling algorithm.
