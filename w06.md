# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Concurrency%20is%20the%20execution%20of,shared%20memory%20or%20message%20passing.)
<br>
Concurrency is the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. It happens in the operating system when there are several process threads running in parallel. The running process threads always communicate with each other through shared memory or message passing. This page will show you the principles of concurrency, problems you might face, advantages and drawbacks of concurrency, also some issue of it.

2. [Introduction of Process Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-management/)
<br>
A process is a program in execution. For example, when we write a program in C or C++ and compile it, the compiler creates binary code. The original code and binary code are both programs. When we actually run the binary code, it becomes a process. This page will show you more about process like what process does look like in memory, attributes of process, state of process, etc.

3. [Process layout in memory](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)
<br>
Process layout in a memory can be represented in 4 different sections: text section, data section, heap section, and stack section.

4. [What Is An Interrupt?](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/interrupts)
<br>
An interrupt is a signal which is sent from a device or from software to the operating system. The interrupt signal causes the operating system to temporarily stop what it is doing and ‘service’ the interrupt.For every interruption, the current task needs to be stopped, with it’s status saved (so it can resume later). This page will show you more about examples of interrupts and a video that explain more about how an interrupt works  

5. [Computer become more complex!](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
In the beginning, computers could only execute one program at a time. Each program will have full control over the system and have access to system resources. As technology develops, computer systems allow many programs to be loaded into memory and run simultaneously, namely on contemporary computers. That way, to run each program, it is called a process. So, the more complex the operating system, the greater the expectation that programs run in the process.

6. [The difference between an OS and a Framework](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/315918/what-is-the-difference-between-an-os-and-a-framework)
<br>
Basically, framework is a re-usable design for a software system (or subsystem). Framework is a very broad term, it can be used to describe many types of subsystems, and tt could even describe an operating system too.
On the other side, operating system is the infrastructure software component of a computer system. Operating System is more specific, it implies facilitation of interaction with a computers or group of computers hardware layer through the use of human user interfaces.

7. [The difference between Direct and Indirect Inter-Process Communication](https://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/disk-operating-system/difference-between-direct-and-indirect-inter-process-communication)
<br>
Inter-Process Communication itself means cooperating processes can communicate in a shared-memory environment. Cooperating processes communicate with each other via an Inter-Process-Communication (IPC) facility. In the Direct Communication, each process that wants to communicate must explicitly name the recipient or sender of the communication. With Indirect Communication, the messages are sent to and received from mailboxes. A mailbox can be viewed abstractly as, an object into which messages can be placed by processes and from which messages can be removed.

8. [Difference between Long-Term and Short-Term Scheduler](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-long-term-and-short-term-scheduler/)
<br>
Long-Term Scheduler (a.k.a Job Scheduler) regulates the programs which are selected to system for processing. In this the programs are setup in the queue and as per the requirement the best one job is selected and it takes the processes from job pool. It regulates the Degree of Multi-programming (DOM). In the other hand, Short-Term Scheduler (a.k.a CPU Scheduler) ensures which program is suitable or important for processing. It regulates the less DOM (Degree of Multi-programming).

9. [Thread](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_multi_threading.htm)
<br>
Thread is an execution flow through the process code, with a program counter that maintains the flow of execution of the next instruction. A thread consists of a program counter, a register set, and a stack space. Basically there are 2 main type of threads:
* User Level thread (ULT) : usually implemented in the user level library, they are not created using the system calls. Thread switching does not need to call OS and to cause interrupt to Kernel. Kernel doesn’t know about the user level thread and manages them as if they were single-threaded processes.
* Kernel Level Thread (KLT) : where kernel knows and manages the threads. Instead of thread table in each process, the kernel itself has thread table (a master one) that keeps track of all the threads in the system. In addition kernel also maintains the traditional process table to keep track of the processes. OS kernel provides system call to create and manage threads.

10. [The difference between Process and Thread](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/)
<br>
Process means any program is in execution. Process control block controls the operation of any process. Process control block contains information about processes for example Process priority, process id, process state, CPU, register, etc. Process takes more time to terminate and it is isolated means it does not share memory with any other process. Thread is the segment of a process means a process can have multiple threads and these multiple threads are contained within a process. A thread have 3 states: running, ready, and blocked. Thread takes less time to terminate as compared to process and like process threads do not isolate.
