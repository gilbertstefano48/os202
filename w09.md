# Top 10 List of Week 09

1. [Storage Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/storage-management/)<br>
Storage Management is defined as it refers to the management of the data storage equipment’s that are used to store the user/computer generated data. Hence it is a tool or set of processes used by an administrator to keep your data and storage equipment’s safe. This link will show you more about features, key elements, and advantages of using it.

2. [Difference between Memory and Storage](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-memory-and-storage/)<br>
This link will give you side-to-side comparison between the two, but basically :
* Memory : made up of registers. Memory refers to the location of short-term data. Each register in the memory is one storage location.
* Storage : allows you to store and access data on a long-term basis.Data remains the same and nothing changes in the hard disk drive: everything gets pulled off into the main memory. Storage allows you to access and store your applications, operating system and files for an indefinite period of time.

3. [What is UEFI?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uefi-full-form/)<br>
UEFI stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. It connects a computer’s firmware to its operating system or we can say it is an interface between computer firmware and operating system. This link will show you more explanation about brief history of UEFI, also advantages and disadvantages of it.

4. [Advantages of UEFI over BIOS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/uefiunified-extensible-firmware-interface-and-how-is-it-different-from-bios/)<br>
There are 4 aspects that makes UEFI better that BIOS :
* Breaking Out Of Size Limitations : The UEFI firmware can boot from drives of 2.2 TB or larger with the theoretical upper limit being 9.4 zettabytes, which is roughly 3 times the size of the total information present on the Internet
* Speed and performance : UEFI can run in 32-bit or 64-bit mode and has more addressable address space than BIOS, which means your boot process is faster.
* More User-Friendly Interface : Since UEFI can run in 32-bit and 64-bit mode, it provides better UI configuration that has better graphics and also supports mouse cursor.
* Security: UEFI also provides the feature of Secure Boot. It allows only authentic drivers and services to load at boot time, to make sure that no malware can be loaded at computer startup.

5. [Difference between Hardware and Firmware](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hardware-and-firmware/)<br>
This link will give you side-to-side comparison between the two, but basically :
* Hardware : the computer’s part that is seen and touched by us. These are the physical parts of the computer which make up the body of our computer (ex: Keyboard, mouse, cabinet, monitor, printer, etc)
* Firmware : a type of software that is associated with your hardware and installed at the time of manufacturing the hardware. It also comes embedded in any of your home appliances such as TVs, washing machines etc. The firmware contains instruction programs to perform basic functions of any hardware.

6. [Android Boot Process](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/android-boot-process/)<br>
Booting is starting up a computer or computer appliance until it can be used. It can be initiated by hardware such as a button press, or by software command. But what is actually happened when a computer is booting? We already learnt about storage, firmware, and bootloader in week 9 (you can also look for w09 slides on os.vlsm.org), and this link will briefly explain you the step-by-step mechanism about android booting.

7. [What is RAID?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)<br>
RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks) is a technique which makes use of a combination of multiple disks instead of using a single disk for increased performance, data redundancy or both. This link will give you full explanation why data redundancy is important, key evaluation points for a RAID System, and different levels of RAID.

8. [Concept behind Multiple Booting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concept-behind-multiple-booting-guide/)<br>
In this week, we've already learnt about GRUB, that stands for GRand Unified Bootloader. This link will give you birefly explanation about concept behind multiple booting, also highlighting the importance of GRUB and MBR role while doing multiple booting.

9. [Systemd, the Linux Controversy](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/understanding-and-using-systemd/)<br>
Systemd is controversial for several reasons: It’s a replacement for something that a lot of Linux users don’t think needs to be replaced, and the antics of the systemd developers have not won hearts and minds. But like it or not, systemd is here to stay, so we might as well know what to do with it. It has it's own utilities, daemons, targets, and libraries. This link will give you a brief explanation how to use systemd.

10. [/etc/init/ and /etc/init.d/, are they same?](https://qastack.id/ubuntu/5039/what-is-the-difference-between-etc-init-and-etc-init-d)<br>
Well it looks different (one has .d, while the other don't), but actually they have the same base. This forum will open your eyes about the difference between the two. The discussion is pretty healthy tho :)
