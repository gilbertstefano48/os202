# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Security](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
Security is a benchmark for maintaining the integrity of systems and data. Security involves protecting computer resources from unauthorized access (unauthorized access), malicious destruction or even alteration, and unintended system inconsistencies. The resources in question are information stored on the system in the form of data or code, then CPU, memory, storage, and on the network. Computers that have a weak security system are prone to damage. For example, if there is an unauthorized user accessing a computer, it could be that the user can damage, change data, and even cause data loss, especially important data stored on the computer.

2. [One Time Passwords](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_security.htm)<br>
One Time Password is a password that can only be used once. On this system, a unique password is required every time a user tries to log into the system. After that, the password can no longer be used, for example: Random Numbers, Secret Keys, and Network Passwords.

3. [Type of Security Breach](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
There are 5 main types of Security Breach, such as:
* Breach of Confidentialit
Breach of Confidentialit means reading and stealing information from a computer system. This breach is quite terrible and should be avoided because important information such as personal data and bank are very confidential.
* Breach of Integrity
Breach of Integrity means there are data modifications made by unauthorized users.
* Breach of Availibility
Breach of Availibility, where data on a computer system is destroyed / deleted .
* Theft of Service
Theft of Service is a breach where our computer can install a program that may take over our computer system, for example an intruder installs a daemon on the system whose story acts as a file server.
* Denial of Service
Denial of Service means making an authorized user unable to use a computer system.

4. [Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-protection-in-operating-system/)<br>
Protection is a mechanism that controls program access, processes, and user restrictions on resources determined by the computer system. In addition, protection also provides a mechanism that implements a kind of policies for the use of resources that exist in a computer system. These policies are usually determined when performing system design, which is carried out by the system management and some of the users in the system to protect their own files and programs.

5. [Principle of Protection](https://www.academia.edu/42880365/Operating_System_Concepts_10th_Edition)<br>
There are 3 principles used in protection: Principle of Least Privilege, Permissions, Defense in depth

6. [Cryptography](https://glints.com/id/lowongan/kriptografi-adalah/#.X3rgIi8Rqu4)<br>
Cryptography is a method used to protect information and communication channels through the use of codes. Cryptography refers to information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations commonly known as algorithms.

7. [Key Encryption Techniques](https://glints.com/id/lowongan/kriptografi-adalah/#.X3rgIi8Rqu4)<br>
There are 2 types of Key Encryption Techniques:
* Symmetric Key Cryptograpy
Symmetric Key Cryptography is cryptography secret key, where the recipient and sender of information only uses one key to encrypt and describe messages. Examples: block, password block, and Data Encryption System.
* Public Key Cryptography
Public Key Cryptography is a cryptographic secret key that uses two interrelated keys, namely the public and private keys. It is considered more secure and secure when compared to symmetric key cryptography. Examples are DSA, PKC, and the curve / ellipse technique.

8. [Firewalls](https://edge-cyber.com/security-tools-services/)<br>
Firewalls is an important security tools service that can protect networks from data theft, malware, unauthorized user logins, and several other threats. The defense done is to block the IP range of the URL to protect data from security breaches. So, if there is an IP or URL that has a bad reputation, firewalls will be able to block that har. 

9. [Access Control List](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwji5N3Djp3sAhVET30KHTYyA7wQFjAFegQICRAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Frendip288.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F08%2F01%2Faccess-control-list%2F&usg=AOvVaw177z8bAn3T9Rq1VngDAIgJ)<br>
The Access Control List is a method for filtering packets in and out of the network through a router. Packets that are usually filtered include IP Source, IP Destination, and TCP / UDP Port. There are 2 types of Access Control Lists, namely the Standard Access Control List, which uses numbers from 1-99 and the Extended Access Control List, which uses numbers from 100 to 199.

10. [Program Threats](https://netsec.id/threats-vulnerabilities/)<br>
Threats programs are programs that can compromise information or processes. This threat is considered as something negative if it affects the confidentiality, integrity and availability of a system or a service. For example, Trojan Horse, Trap Door, Logic Bomb, and Viruses.
