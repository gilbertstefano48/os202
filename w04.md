# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Main Memory](https://technologyinformation97.blogspot.com/2016/11/pengertian-dan-peraranan-main.html)<br>
Main Memory is a storage medium in the form of an array composed of words or bytes, the storage capacity of which can be up to millions of arrangements. In the Hierarchy of memory, each word or byte must have a different address, so each address must be unique. Main memory is data storage that is volatile, which means volatile data itself is data that if stored is temporary, if the components are not connected to electricity, the stored data will be lost. Main memory is usually used for data that will be processed by the CPU whose orders can be set using I/O devices.

2. [Secondary Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-secondary-memory/)<br>
Secondary memory is also referred to as external memory and refers to the various storage media in which a computer can store data and programs. Uniquely, it's easy to install and remove, which is important not to do it while transferring or opening data. Some of it are also planted on a computer system, known as internal disk storage. Secondary memory has 2 types based on how it is positioned on the computer. For example, for fixed storage there are Internal Flash Memory, Solid-State Disk (SSD), and Hard Disk Drives (HDD). For removable storage, there are Optical Discs (CD, DVD, Blu-ray Disc), Memory Card, Floppy Disk, Magnetic tapes, Disk packs, and Paper storage.

3. [Main memory vs Secondary Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-primary-and-secondary-memory/)<br>
Primary memory is the computer memory that is directly accessible by CPU. It is comprised of DRAM and provides the actual working space to the processor. It holds the data and instructions that the processor is currently working on. While in secondary memory, the contents first get transferred to the primary memory and then are accessed by the processor, this is because the processor does not directly interact with the secondary memory.
This link will show you more about the comparison between the two.

4. [Random Access Memory](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/types-of-computer-memory.html)<br>
RAM (Random Access Memory) is a main memory that accesses data by access without regard to any order. So, you could say that random bits of data can be accessed as fast as accessing other data. RAM is Volatile and very fast both in accessing data, reading, and writing data, but it will lose function when there is no electricity. In this link, you will be shown that it RAM has various types, namely Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) and Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)

5. [Read Only Memory](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/types-of-computer-memory.html)<br>
ROM (Read Only Memory) is one of the main memories that can read data, but can't be written to that memory. ROM is a type of memory on a computer that is very fast and is usually installed near the CPU on the motherboard. ROM is non-volatile, in contrast to RAM. ROM can read the information stored in it when the computer is turned on. It contains bootstrap code, which is a series of basic instructions that the computer needs to run to find out what OS is stored in secondary memory, and load the OS into primary memory so that it can be turned on and ready for use. There are several types of ROM: Programmable Read-only Memory (PROM), Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM), and Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM)

6. [Cache Memory](https://idwebhost.com/blog/pengertian-fungsi-dan-tipe-cache-pada-komputer/)<br>
Cache is a memory that is small in size and temporary. Even though the file size is very small, the performance is very high. In hardware, cache memory usually refers to high-speed memory that bridges the flow of data between the processor and main memory, namely RAM which has a much lower speed. The use of cache aims to minimize bottlenecks in the flow of data between the processor and RAM. In software, cache memory refers to a temporary storage area for frequently accessed files which are usually implemented in the network.

7. [Shared Memory](https://cuapcuapcomputer.wordpress.com/tag/shared-memory/)<br>
Shared Memory is a technology that allows computer programs to share memory resources simultaneously for higher performance and fewer copies of redundant data. Shared Memory Systems can run on single processor systems, parallel multiprocessors, or clustered microprocessors. This technology is a little different for distributed systems, but shared memory can also operate on those systems

8. [Virtual Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)<br>
Virtual Memory is a memory management technique where secondary memory is used as if it were part of main memory. Virtual memory makes use of hardware and software that allows the computer to compensate for the lack of physical memory, by transferring temporary data from RAM to disk storage. In essence, virtual memory allows a computer to treat secondary memory as if it were primary memory. Virtual memory plays a role in improving system performance, multitasking, when using large and flexible programs. However, users should not rely on virtual memory, because virtual data usage is quite slower than RAM usage. If the OS has to swap data between virtual memory and RAM, it allows the computer to feel slow and it is called thrashing.

9. [Thrasing](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4766/thrashing)<br>
Thrashing is an activity that keeps the computer from progressing. Usually, this occurs because of limited resources or running out of memory capacity. This can occur when a page fault occurs, where the page fault occurs when memory access from virtual memory space cannot map it to RAM contents. When the main memory fills up, the additional pages need to be swapped in and out of virtual memory. These exchanges lead to very high levels of hard disk access. Thrashing can continue for a long duration. Thrashing also allows the computer hard drive to die completely.

10. [Logical and Physical Address in Operating System](https://www.enterprisestorageforum.com/storage-hardware/types-of-computer-memory.html)<br>
Logical Address is generated by CPU while a program is running. The logical address is virtual address as it does not exist physically, therefore, it is also known as Virtual Address. This address is used as a reference to access the physical memory location by CPU. The term Logical Address Space is used for the set of all logical addresses generated by a programâ€™s perspective. Physical Address identifies a physical location of required data in a memory. The user never directly deals with the physical address but can access by its corresponding logical address. The user program generates the logical address and thinks that the program is running in this logical address but the program needs physical memory for its execution, therefore, the logical address must be mapped to the physical address by MMU before they are used. The term Physical Address Space is used for all physical addresses corresponding to the logical addresses in a Logical address space. This link will show you more about differences between the two.
