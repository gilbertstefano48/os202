# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Process Synchronization](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/process-synchronization#)<br>
Synchronization is divided into 2 distinct but related concepts, namely Synchronization of Processes and Synchronization of Data. Process synchronization refers to the idea that several processes will join at a certain point, until they reach a commit in the sequence of actions. Data synchronization refers to the idea of ​​keeping multiple copies of a data set in coherence with others, or also to maintain the integrity of the data.

2. [Semaphores in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
In operating systems, semaphore is a variable or abstract data type used to control access to common resources with multiple processes in a concurrent system such as a multitasking operating system. Semaphores are commonly used to solve critical section problems and achieve process synchronization in multi-processing environments.

3. [Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)<br>
Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. For an example, when two trains are coming toward each other on the same track and there is only one track, none of the trains can move once they are in front of each other. A similar situation occurs in operating systems when there are two or more processes that hold some resources and wait for resources held by other(s)

4. [Deadlock Characterization](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/deadlock-characterization)
<br>
Deadlocks occur in the operating system when two or more processes require resources to complete their execution which are held back by other processes. Deadlock occurs when all four Coffman conditions are declared true. They are described as Mutual Exclusion, Hold, Wait, No Preemption and Circular Wait.

5. [Coffman Conditions?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-deadlocks-in-operating-system)
<br>
A deadlock occurs if the four Coffman conditions hold true, but these conditions are not mutually exclusive. The four condionts are 
* Mutual Exclusion
* Hold and Wait
* No Preemption
* Circular Wait
This website will explain you more about what actually these four.

6. [The Bounded-Buffer Problem](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/what-is-bounded-buffer-problem)
<br>
The bounded-buffer problem is also known as the producer consumer problem. This problem is generalized in terms of the Producer-Consumer Problem. The solution to this problem is to make two semaphore counting "full" and "empty" for the track sum of each full buffer and empty buffer.

7. [The Banker's Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bankers-algorithm-in-operating-system-2/)
<br>
Banker's Algorithms is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests security by simulating allocations for a predefined maximum number of all resources, then creates a "state-s" check to test possible activities, before deciding whether allocations should continue.

8. [The Readers-Writers Problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/readers-writers-problem-set-1-introduction-and-readers-preference-solution/)<br>
Probelm ini dapat dimengerti dengan contoh situasi yang akan saya jelaskan. Jika salah satu orang mencoba mengedit file, maka tidak ada yang boleh membaca atau menulis secara bersamaan. Tetapi, jika beberapa orang membaca file tersebut, maka orang lain dapat membacanya juga pada saat yang bersamaan. Ini yang bisa disebut sebagai The Readers-Writer Problem.

9. [Peterson’s Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/?ref=rp)
<br>
Peterson’s Algorithm is used to synchronize two processes. It uses two variables, a bool array flag of size 2 and an int variable turn to accomplish it. Implement Peterson’s Algorithm for the two processes using shared memory such that there is mutual exclusion between them.This link will give you an explanation about how this algorithm works and an example code in c language.

10. [Difference between Deadlock and Starvation in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/)<br>
Essentially, Deadlock occurs when each process holds a resource and wait for other resource held by any other process. In the other hand, Starvation occurs when high priority processes keep executing and low priority processes get blocked for indefinite time.
